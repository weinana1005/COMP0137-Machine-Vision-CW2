    "This second half of the lab explores the geometry of a single camera. In 2B the goal is to use a set of correspondance points to estimate a transformation matrix from a plane's 3D space to camera space and use that matrix to project some other points into camera space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll work on building two components that we need for 2B, a method to estimate that transformation and a method that can project points into camera image space.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll tackle the projection method, `projectiveCamera`. We want to find the image space coordinates, `XImCart`, of a set of 3D world coordinates, `XCart`, given a camera intrinsics matrix `K` and an extrinsics matrix `T`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is a method to estimate a Eucledian transformation, `TEst`, that takes us from a plane's 3D coordinate space to 3D camera space by utilizing a given set of points in camera image space, `XImCart`, and a set of corresponding points in world space, `XCart`. Essentially we want to compute the extrinsics matrix we can use in `projectiveCamera`.\n",

    "Estimating the camera pose will involve calculating a homography, so you'll need to copy over your functions from part 1A/1B in the space provided."
